### About me

I’m Adam Bourg. The blogger behind this site. I’m a computer geek and all around great guy. I write software for a living and I’ve worked for startups, the USDA, a couple non-profits and now a big consulting company.

My passion is for building web applications. I work across the stack but I have a fondness for Ruby, Ruby on Rails and some Javascript frameworks. I work exclusively on a Mac and I deploy only to *nix hosts. I have a strong distaste for any kind of Windows based platform or technology.

When I’m not writing blog posts or software, I tend to write more software, bake a lot of cookies and I also spend a lot of time with my wife and our cat and dog.

If you want to see my resume or connect with me professionally, you can visit my LinkedIn profile. I’m open to all connection requests, yes, even from recruiters.
